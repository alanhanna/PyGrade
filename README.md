# PyGrade
Utilities to simplify the process of grading and providing feedback.

Three separate desktop GUI applications have been created using tkinter. They are intended as companion tools to assist teachers/lecturers to grade student work and provide feedback. All data is stored locally in text files.

[Executables are available from the project homepage](https://sites.google.com/view/pygrade)



## PyGrade

This utility is for assigning marks and providing feedback comments. Marks and feedback can be manually typed or selected from those previously configured/entered. Key features are:

* Dropdown class list
* Configurable number of questions
* Selectable feedback comments
* Automatic aggregation
* PDF feedback reports



## PyCommentBank

This utility maintains a collection of feedback comments (grouped by category).  Selected comments are automatically added to the clipboard to be pasted as annotations.

When marking, assessors can add recurring feedback comments to the comment bank which can then be easily selected for immediate annotation of student work.



## PyUpload

Utility to allow student marks, summary comments, and graded work to be uploaded in bulk to Canvas (a virtual learning environment).
